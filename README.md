# Odin Landing Page

This is the landing page project for the CSS module of The Odin Project course. I will document the structure and share my thoughts on development of the page, if any, mainly for self reflection.

## Structure

The structure of the page will be as follows:

1) Header - Divided into `logo` and menu (`ul`)
2) Hero section - Divided into `hero-right` and a `hero-left` section
3) Information or content section - Divided into `content-heading` and `content-icon-list`
4) Block quote section - Divided into the `blockquote` itself and speaker (class `cite`)
5) Call-to-action (CTA) section - Divided into `cta-left` and `cta-right`
6) Footer - Copyright info
